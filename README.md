# FabMo-Stand-App

This app generates the GCode used to create a stand device (for phone, etc).
The goal of this app is to prove that it can be easy to create an app, even
by using an other language than JavaScript (if this language is
compiled/translated into JavaScript at the end).

This app is written in Haxe.
